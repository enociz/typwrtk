A simple page that uses local storage to help you to write notes on the go â€” [Use it!](http://typwr.tk) (it's pronounced Typewrite K, btw).

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

Sometimes, it's just too tedious to get a little place to write notes and questions down online while surfing the web. TYPWRTK fixes this by giving you a quick place to write which is saved to `localhost://` and sync with the site as long as you haven't deleted browser history.

## What?

Just plain old black screen, white text, bold, italics, underline and nothing more:

## How?

Just visit the site on [http://typwr.tk](http://typwr.tk).
